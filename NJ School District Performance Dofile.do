// "*" == that data was available for too few students to report the given information, or the data represents a small percentage of students. There may be some additional cases where the data was kept private because the data could be used to potentially identify individual students. //

// "**" ==  data was not available for the minimum 20 students, the required number for a student group to be included in New Jerseyâ€™s Every Student Succeeds Act ESS accountability system. //

// ".999" == indicates that no data was available to report. This happens when there are no students enrolled in a particular student group or if no data was submitted by the district. //

// The following commands show basic descriptive statistics //

sum LALDistrictPerformance,d // This statstic shows that on average at the **District Level** 56.9% of students met or exceeded expectations in their performance on ELA assessments. Students in the upper quartile met or exceeded expectations at 71.9% while the lower quartile shows that 41.2% met or exceeded expectations with a SD of about 20.5%. The data is very slightly skewed to the left. // 

sum LALStatePerformance,d // This statistic shows that on average at the **State Level** 52.7% of students met or exceeded expectations in their performance on ELA assessments. This is a lower average of assessment expectations met or exceeded than when measuring at the district level by 4.2%. This trend continues in the upper quartile however at the state level a higer proportion of student met or exceeded assessment expectations at the lower quartile. //

sum MATHDistrictPerformance,d // On average at the district level 44.8% of students met or exceeded expectations on their performance on math assessments. At the upper and lower quartile students met or exceeded expectations at 30.7% and 61.1% respectively. The data is slightly skewed to the right. //

sum MATHStatePerformance, d // On average 43.9% of students met or exceed expectations on their performance on math assessments at the state level. This is only slightly less than the average at the district level. Overall, at the upper quartile 50.5% of students met or exceeded expectations and in the lower quartile only 23.7% met or exceeded expectations. //
